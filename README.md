# Mass-Spectrometry-Simulation
This GIF is a Monte Carlo primary simulation for a Mass spectrometer to analyze and detect a mixture of gas elements.
It includes a filament part to produce electrons, an ionization container,  accelerator cathodes, and a magnetic analyzer.
The target gas can be helium and or hydrogen.
